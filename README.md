This is a landing page of one of the most famous NFTs - The Bored Ape Yacht Club. 
The application was developed using the React library.
The app was developed following a mobile-first approach. Layout is Adaptive, for mobile devices (360px-480px), tablets (768px), and wide screens (1280px).
In this project, I used such technology as React-Hook-Form, React-responsive, Swiperjs, and PropTypes.
